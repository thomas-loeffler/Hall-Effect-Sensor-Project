This was a semester-long project completed in ECE 483 Instrument Systems. The goal of the project was to select a sensor and a microcontroller to create an instrumentation device
with an economical and manufacturing-friendly package. Myself and one other electrical engineer worked together on the electronics for this project. 
We collaborated with a team of Design Engineering Technology (DET) students who took the reigns on the package design, including manufacturing and customer considerations.
