This was a semester-long project completed in ECE 483 Instrument Systems. The goal of the project was to select a sensor and a microcontroller to create an instrumentation device with an economical and manufacturing-friendly package. Myself and one other electrical engineer worked together on the electronics for this project. We collaborated with a team of Design Engineering Technology (DET) students who took the reigns on the package design, including manufacturing and customer considerations. A Hall effect sensor was used with a Raspberry Pi Pico for 2 different applications: A bike speedometer/odometer, and a "pizza cutter-like" handheld measurement tool. All of the .py files and report documents are attached to this project, see "Instruments Report" for more details.
